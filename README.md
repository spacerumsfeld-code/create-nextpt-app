Create-NPT-App (CNA)

CNA is an easy to initialize, opinionated boilerplate that allows you to start building web applications in a hurry. Modeled after the renowned create-react-app and create-next-app, CNA saves you the time of configuring every single new application. Here's what is included after you run 'npx create-npt-app':

-Next.JS for hybrid rendering of pages, serverless function API routes, and page-based routing;
-Prisma ORM for quick and easy connection to your favorite database and easy seeding/migration
-TypeScript for industry-standard typing and Intellisense to reduce build-time errors
